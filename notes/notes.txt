==UPDATE==

4/3/16
Overhauling the original code. 
This works waaay better.


4/4/16
Plan is probably do concurrency last? But at least allow for the flag to be passed in. 

==== PLANNED FLAGS ====
-h header
-n number of request
-c number of concurrent requests 
-m for request type 
- Any others?

THINGS TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD
	--THREAD POOLS BASED ON THE CONCURRENCY FACTOR
	--SYNCING THE THREADS TO GET THE AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME
	--PASSING IN JSON TO USE AS THE POST BODIES FOR SOME.


--------------OUTSIDE TOOLS--------
1. https://gocover.io/  : For testing and just to try it out. 


-----PROJECT NOTES-------

Probably going to test my implementation against AB and see how close I get.
