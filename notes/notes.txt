Go packages I will probably need:
	1. OS
	2. io/ioutil
	3. io
	4. fmt 
	5. path
	6. time 
	7. strconv
	8. runtime 
	9. flags
	10. strings
	11. http

-h header
-n number of request
-c number of concurrent requests 
-m for request type 

----------------------PLAN AS OF 2-27-16-----------------------
	1. check the request type they are trying to send
	2. look for the url
	3. format all the necessary data for the http package
	4. perhaps some profit? 
	
	THINGS TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD
	--THREAD POOLS BASED ON THE CONCURRENCY FACTOR
	--SYNCING THE THREADS TO GET THE AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME
